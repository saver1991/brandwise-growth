            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. Subscriptions</h2>
            <p>
              Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or BrandWise Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting BrandWise Inc. customer support team.
            </p>
            <p>
              A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide BrandWise Inc. with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize BrandWise Inc. to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
